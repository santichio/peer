# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A documentation repository that standardizes and centralizes AI-related documents —
**skills, prompts, agents, templates, and references**. There is no build system, no
package manager, and no tests: every "artifact" is a Markdown document that conforms to
a shared standard. Work here is authoring and maintaining those documents and keeping
the catalog consistent.

## Non-negotiable document standard

Every **non-skill** document (reference, prompt, agent, template) is a copy of
[`templates/base-document.md`](templates/base-document.md) and must have:

- **YAML frontmatter** with: `title`, `id` (kebab-case, **matches the filename stem**),
  `type` (`prompt|agent|template|reference`), `version` (SemVer), `status`
  (`draft|active|deprecated`), `owner`, `created`, `updated`, `tags`, `description`
  (one line, reused verbatim in `INDEX.md`), and optional `related` (list of doc ids).
  Deprecated docs also carry `deprecated_on` / `replaced_by`.
- **No per-document changelog section.** History lives in a per-directory `CHANGELOG.md`
  (see below). This was a deliberate change — do not reintroduce `## Changelog` sections.
- GitHub-flavored Markdown; **all diagrams in Mermaid** (renders natively on GitHub).

**Skills are the exception** — they do NOT use the base template or this frontmatter. A
skill is a folder `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in the [SKILL.md format](skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md):
`name` + `description` frontmatter (no version/status/owner), imperative body, optional
bundled `scripts/ references/ assets/`. Authored via the `skill-creator` skill. Don't
modify anything under `skills/skill-creator/`.

## Layout

- **Non-skill docs:** `<category>/<topic>/<id>.md` — categories `prompts/ agents/
  references/`; documents grouped in **topic** subfolders (e.g. `references/git/`,
  `references/engineering/`). `templates/` holds the base template directly.
- **Skills:** flat `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — one self-contained folder per skill, no
  topic subfolder.

## Creating a new document

> **Exception — skills.** To create a skill, use the
> [`skill-creator`](skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md) skill — it produces a
> `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in the SKILL.md format (not the base template). Then register it
> in `INDEX.md` (Skills table, version/status `—`) and `skills/CHANGELOG.md` (by date). The
> steps below are for non-skill documents.

1. **Copy the template.** `cp templates/base-document.md <category>/<topic>/<id>.md`.
   Pick the category (`skills/ prompts/ agents/ references/`) and a topic subfolder
   (e.g. `git`, `engineering`). Create the topic folder if it's new. The filename stem
   **is** the `id` (kebab-case).
2. **Fill the frontmatter.** All required fields; `version: 1.0.0`; `created` and
   `updated` = today (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`); `status` usually `active` (or `draft`); set
   `related` ids. Write the body in GFM (Mermaid for diagrams), remove unused optional
   sections, and **do not add a `## Changelog` section**.
3. **Register in `INDEX.md`.** Add one row under the matching category table:
   `| [\`<id>\`](<category>/<topic>/<id>.md) | <Title> | <version> | <status> | <description> |`.
   The description must match the frontmatter `description` verbatim.
4. **Log in the directory `CHANGELOG.md`** (`<category>/CHANGELOG.md`, one level above the
   topic folder). Add a block grouped by id:
   ```markdown
   ## `<id>`

   ### [1.0.0] — <today>
   #### Added
   - <one-line summary of what the document provides>
   ```
   **First doc in a category?** That `CHANGELOG.md` won't exist yet — create it by copying
   the header from an existing one (e.g. `references/CHANGELOG.md`), and delete the
   category's `.gitkeep` placeholder.
5. **Update `README.md` only if the structure changed** — i.e. you added a **new category**
   or a **new topic subfolder**. Add it to the "Repository structure" table and the Mermaid
   diagram (mirror how `references/git/` is shown). Adding a doc to an *existing* topic needs
   no README change.
6. **Verify links** with the checker in the [Cross-links](#cross-links) section.

## Changing an existing document

1. **Edit the file**, then bump `version` (SemVer: MAJOR = breaking/meaning change,
   MINOR = additive, PATCH = wording/typo) and set `updated` to today.
2. **Add a new version entry** at the top of that document's `## \`<id>\`` block in the
   directory `CHANGELOG.md` (newest first), under the right category — Added / Changed /
   Deprecated / Removed / Fixed / Security.
3. **Sync `INDEX.md`** if the row's visible fields changed (`version`, `title`, `status`,
   or `description`).
4. **Renaming / moving** (id change): rename the file and `id` together, update every
   inbound relative link and `related` reference, fix the `INDEX.md` path, and note it in
   the `CHANGELOG.md`. Then run the link checker.
5. **Deprecating:** set `status: deprecated`, add `deprecated_on` and (if applicable)
   `replaced_by`; update the `INDEX.md` status; log under **Deprecated** in the changelog.

> The repo-root `CHANGELOG.md` is only for repo-level changes (README, INDEX structure,
> governance files) — not for individual document edits, which go in the category changelog.

## Cross-links

Documents reference each other with **relative Markdown links** and via the `related`
frontmatter (which uses ids, not paths). Because of the two-deep layout, links between
categories use `../../` (e.g. a `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` links a reference as
`../../references/git/<id>.md`). After moving or adding files, verify every link resolves
(the checker below — the `skills/skill-creator/` bundle's internal links are out of scope):

```bash
# from repo root — prints BROKEN lines for any unresolved relative .md link
grep -rEn "\]\([^)]+\.md[^)]*\)" --include='*.md' . | while IFS= read -r line; do
  file="${line%%:*}"; rest="${line#*:}"; rest="${rest#*:}"
  echo "$rest" | grep -oE "\]\([^)#]+\.md" | sed -E 's/^\]\(//' | while IFS= read -r t; do
    [ "$t" = "../references/other-doc-id.md" ] && continue   # template placeholder
    [ -e "$(dirname "$file")/$t" ] || echo "BROKEN: $file -> $t"
  done
done
```

## This repo follows its own git policy

The git references under `references/git/` are the policy this repo is governed by, and
`skills/gitflow/SKILL.md` is the operational procedure. When making changes here:

- Branch from `develop` (not `main`); both are default branches. Name branches
  `feature/<issue_id>-<name>` (or `hotfix/`). See `references/git/git-branching-strategy.md`.
- Commits follow Conventional Commits, **header ≤ 50 chars**, standard types only
  (the custom `cleanup`/`remove`/`raw` types were removed). See
  `references/git/git-commit-conventions.md`. `docs(...)` is the usual type for content here.
- **Do not self-merge.** Open a PR (base `develop`) and stop for review —
  `references/git/git-code-review.md` requires ≥1 approval; `.github/CODEOWNERS` routes it.

## Conventions quick reference

- `id` and filenames are kebab-case; `id` == filename stem.
- Dates are ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `temp/` holds raw, un-standardized source material that gets converted into documents;
  it is not part of the catalog. Leave its files unless asked to clean up.
- See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full "add a document" procedure and
  [`README.md`](README.md) for the metadata reference and status lifecycle.
